1. First, verify that django is installed, go to shell:
import django
if it works, continue

2. run: django-admin.py startproject psu_gcal
   \\if that doesn't work, try django-admin startproject psu_gcal
   \\its bad to put this stuff in the doc root bcuz then folks might
   \\be able to see the code you're running

3. edit settings.py to have the correct database...
   \\FOR SQLite3: just insert the desired location for the db file
      \\it will automatically be created when you sync the first time.
      \\don't enter a name, password, host, or port
      \\engine = 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'
    also the correct timezone...
    
    ***don't actually have to make it from scratch, just use the one from
    git; DO EDIT THE PATHS THO, thx***

4. run manage.py syncdb
   \\this step creates the db and allows you to create a superuser acct
   \\for django admin

5. At this point, got to set up the permission, using models.py file...
   To do this, edit settings, INSTALLED_APPS to point to the dir that
   the models.py script is in.

6. Add yourself as superadmin, via the shell: python manage.py shell
      >>> from django.conf import settings
      >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User, check_password
      >>> user = User.objects.get(username='magarvey')
      >>> user.is_staff
      False
      >>> user.is_staff = True
      >>> user.is_superuser = True
      >>> user.save()

7. Edit the apache vhost conf from the root dir in the git version
   and place it in the proper location.

8. Give apache read write permissions to the db file as well as the directory
   containing the db.
